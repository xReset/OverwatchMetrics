# Overwatch 2 Stats Dashboard

A clean, local-first dashboard for tracking Overwatch 2 hero performance powered by real data from Blizzard's official stats page.

## What it does

Ever wonder which heroes are actually dominating the meta? This scrapes 100% real Overwatch 2 statistics directly from Blizzard's website and displays them in a beautiful, interactive dashboard.

- Real-time data - No mock numbers, no hallucinations, just pure Blizzard stats
- Smart visualizations - Clean heatmap grid with sortable columns and search
- All the filters - Mode, tier, region, platform, you name it
- Official hero portraits - Real Blizzard artwork, not generic icons
- Responsive design - Works great on desktop and mobile

## How it works

1. Scraper hits Blizzard's API every day (or whenever you run it)
2. Backend serves up the data via a clean REST API  
3. Frontend displays everything in a gorgeous, interactive interface

The magic? It compares data over time so you can see which heroes are climbing the meta and which ones are falling off.

## Quick start

```bash
# Install everything
npm run install-all

# Start the backend
npm run dev:backend

# Start the frontend (in another terminal)
npm run dev:frontend
```

Visit `http://localhost:4321` and you're good to go!

## Features I'm proud of

- Heatmap Grid - My favorite! Sortable, searchable, with real hero portraits
- Metric Toggle - Switch between pick rate and win rate instantly  
- Role Filtering - Focus on Tanks, Damage, or Support heroes
- Smart Pagination - Handles all 50 heroes without overwhelming you
- Change Tracking - Shows who's rising and falling in the meta

## Tech stuff

- Frontend: Astro + React + TailwindCSS (no bloated frameworks)
- Backend: Node.js + Express (simple, fast)
- Data: Real Blizzard API calls via Puppeteer
- Storage: Local JSON files (no complex database needed)

## Why I built this

I was tired of seeing fake Overwatch stats everywhere. Every site had "mock data" or numbers that didn't match reality. So I built something that pulls directly from the source - Blizzard's own API.

Now I can see exactly what's happening in the meta, track trends over time, and make better hero choices.
